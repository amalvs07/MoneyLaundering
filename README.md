# MoneyLaundering
Money laundering is a serious criminal activity that involves disguising the proceeds of 
crime as legitimate funds. With the rise of digital transactions, detecting money laundering 
has become more challenging than ever before. Machine learning (ML) algorithms have 
shown tremendous potential in detecting money laundering fraud. This abstract discusses 
how ML algorithms can be used to identify money laundering activities.
